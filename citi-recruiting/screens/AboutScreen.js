            <Text style={{marginBottom:20}}>David Kim is an SMU, Class of 2017, graduate and a CATE 2017 full-time analyst who is completing his first rotation in the CitiDeveloper Platform. There, he has worked on expanding automation efforts for onboarding users into newer technologies such as Artifactory and Cloudbees Jenkins, which have both replaced applications that are more than 10 years old.  These two applications are critical components of Citi's containerization strategy as two major portions of the CI/CD pipeline. For Davidâ€™s second year in the program he will soon rotate to the CitiData platform where he will be aligned to the database automation team. This will allow him to contribute to innovations with NoSQL database technologies like MongoDB.</Text>
